     <p>Nature is the most beautiful and powerful creation of God. It includes everything around us — the trees, rivers, mountains, sky, animals, and even us, humans. Nature gives us life, food, shelter, and everything we need to survive. It teaches us to live peacefully and stay connected with the world.</p>
    
    <br>
    
         <p>Nature is calm, yet strong. A cool breeze can refresh your mind, while a storm reminds us of its power. Birds chirping, leaves rustling, and the sight of a sunset — these little things make us feel alive.</p>
